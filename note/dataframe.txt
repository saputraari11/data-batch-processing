Yes, they will be stored in memory, and that's the reason why you want to chunk them - that allows you to not read the whole data set in at the same time, 
but process it in chunks before writing out the end result.

You can use chunksize to tell pandas how many rows should be read for each chunk. 
If you need a complete set of rows to perform arbitrary lookups, you'll have to back it with some other technology (such as a database).

partition in dataframe or partition is some row that has been gathered into one group.

let say if we want chunk row is 100000.
that means 100000 row,we can save it into chunk or partition.
